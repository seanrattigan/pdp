Q1
a
i) Data type is a type of data such as number (int or float)
 or a string, or a list, tuple or dict
 int bool float and int only store one value for that type
 but the others are also data structures tha store many values
 
ii) namespace is usaully in referece to a module, but it referes to where
  a var or fuc or class exists
  
  
iii) 2 + 3 * 4 is not 20, it is 14 because of the order of operations of the operators
  It follows PEMDAS, so multiplication gets done before addition.
  It means you have to be careful that the ops get done int he order you want
  
iv) Reserved words a builtin keywords in Python- cannot use them as
    variable or function names, e.g. print, input, len etc.
    
v) Exception: when python encounters an error, an exception is raised- it doesn't know how to proceed
  e.g. ValueError- an invalid value of the correct type or
       TypeError- the wrong type used, e.g. "2" * "5"
       
vi) Objects are mutable (e.g list, dict) or immutable (str, tup, int, float)
  If some obj is immutable it cannot be modified, e.g.
  word = 'hello' ; cannot do word[0] = 'f' -> immutable
  shopping_list = [], can do shooping_ist.append("item") -> mutable
